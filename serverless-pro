By completing the AWS101 Architecture workshop, I designed and implemented a secure, internet-connected AWS cloud infrastructure from scratch.

I worked with:

* AWS VPC Design
* Subnetting & Routing
* Internet Gateway Configuration
* EC2 Deployment
* Security Group Management
* Elastic IP Association
* Amazon S3
* IAM Roles & Policies
* Cloud Networking Fundamentals

This project demonstrates practical experience in designing a secure AWS network, deploying compute resources, integrating storage, and implementing identity-based access control following best practices.

# 🏗 Step-by-Step Implementation with Explanation

---

## 1️⃣ Designed a Custom VPC

* Created a VPC with a defined CIDR block.
* Established isolated networking environment.

**Explanation:**
A VPC forms the foundation of AWS networking and provides complete control over IP addressing, routing, and security.

---

## 2️⃣ Created Subnets (Subnetting & Routing)

* Created a Public Subnet inside the VPC.
* Planned IP allocation properly.
* Associated subnet with route table.

**Explanation:**
Subnetting divides the network into logical sections, improving scalability and security control.

---

## 3️⃣ Configured Internet Gateway

* Created and attached Internet Gateway to the VPC.
* Added route `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW`.

**Explanation:**
Internet Gateway enables communication between instances in the public subnet and the internet.

---

## 4️⃣ Deployed EC2 Instance

* Selected AMI and instance type.
* Configured key pair for SSH.
* Launched instance in public subnet.

**Explanation:**
EC2 provides scalable virtual compute capacity in AWS.

---

## 5️⃣ Configured Security Groups

* Allowed SSH (Port 22).
* Allowed HTTP (Port 80).

**Explanation:**
Security Groups act as stateful firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic at instance level.

---

## 6️⃣ Associated Elastic IP

* Allocated Elastic IP.
* Attached it to EC2 instance.

**Explanation:**
Elastic IP ensures a static public IP for consistent access.

---

## 7️⃣ Created and Configured Amazon S3

* Created S3 bucket.
* Uploaded files or static content.
* Configured permissions.

**Explanation:**
S3 provides highly durable object storage used for backups, static website hosting, and file storage.
---

## 8️⃣ Implemented IAM

* Created IAM roles and policies.
* Attached IAM role to EC2 for secure S3 access.

**Explanation:**
IAM ensures secure, temporary, and role-based access control without storing access keys.

# 🎤 Combined Advanced Interview Questions & Answers

---

## 1️⃣ Explain complete traffic flow from internet to EC2.

**Answer:**
Traffic flows from the internet → Internet Gateway → Route Table → Public Subnet → EC2 instance (if Security Group allows it). Return traffic is automatically allowed because Security Groups are stateful.

---

## 2️⃣ What are the requirements for EC2 to access the internet?

**Answer:**

1. Internet Gateway attached
2. Route table entry (0.0.0.0/0 → IGW)
3. Public or Elastic IP assigned

All three must be properly configured.

---

## 3️⃣ Difference between Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway?

**Answer:**
Internet Gateway allows inbound and outbound internet access for public instances.
NAT Gateway allows outbound internet access for private instances without exposing them publicly.

---

## 4️⃣ How can EC2 securely access S3?

**Answer:**
By attaching an IAM role with required S3 permissions to the EC2 instance. For higher security, use a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3.

---

## 5️⃣ Why is IAM role better than access keys?

**Answer:**
IAM roles provide temporary credentials, automatic rotation, and eliminate storing permanent access keys inside instances.

---

## 6️⃣ What is CIDR and why is it important?

**Answer:**
CIDR defines the IP range of a VPC. It determines the number of subnets and hosts available and ensures scalable network design.

---

## 7️⃣ How would you troubleshoot EC2 internet connectivity issues?

**Answer:**
Check:

* Internet Gateway attachment
* Route table configuration
* Subnet association
* Public/Elastic IP
* Security Group rules
* NACL rules

Systematic checking helps identify root cause quickly.

---

## 8️⃣ What are security risks in this basic architecture?

**Answer:**

* SSH open to 0.0.0.0/0
* Single AZ deployment
* No monitoring
* No encryption enforced on S3

These can be improved for production.

---

## 9️⃣ How would you make this architecture production-ready?

**Answer:**

* Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
* Use Auto Scaling Group
* Add Application Load Balancer
* Use NAT Gateway for private subnet
* Enable CloudWatch monitoring
* Enable S3 encryption and versioning

---

## 🔟 If converting this to Infrastructure as Code, what would you use?

**Answer:**
I would use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to automate VPC creation, subnet setup, EC2 deployment, IAM roles, and S3 configuration for repeatable and scalable infrastructure management.

# 💼 Final Resume Statement

Designed and implemented a secure AWS cloud infrastructure integrating VPC networking, EC2 compute services, Amazon S3 storage, and IAM-based access control. Configured subnetting, routing, internet connectivity, and security controls while applying cloud networking best practices.
